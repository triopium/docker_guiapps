property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If
NO-CLONE is a function, then it is called with two arguments: the
package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.

:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,

:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the

:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:after           Delay the use-package declaration until after the named modules
                 have loaded. Once load, it will be as though the use-package
                 declaration (without `:after') had been seen at that moment.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
